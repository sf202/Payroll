# Payroll
Write a java program (called payroll.java) that reads worker’s payroll information and computes the amount of pay for a worker. The worker’s payroll information to read (using proper prompts) includes:
- Employee's name
- Number of hours worked
- Hourly rate of pay
- Federal tax rate
The program then computes and displays the following outputs with appropriate labels. Use the tab escape character or “ ” to align your outputs after the labels. The gross pay is the hours worked times the hourly rate, and the net pay is the gross pay minus all taxes.
Employee name
Hours worked
Hourly rate
Gross pay
Tax deducted
Net pay
